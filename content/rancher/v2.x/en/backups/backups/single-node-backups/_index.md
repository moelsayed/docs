After completing your single node installation of Rancher create a backup of your current installation. Use this backup as a restoration point in disaster scenarios.

>**Prerequisite:** Open Rancher and write down the version number displayed in the lower-left of the browser (example: `v2.0.0`). You'll need this number during the backup process.

1. Stop the container currently running Rancher Server. Replace `<RANCHER_CONTAINER_ID>` with the ID of your Rancher container.

    ```bash
docker stop <RANCHER_CONTAINER_ID>
    ```

    >**Tip:** You can obtain the ID for your Rancher container by entering the following command: `docker ps`.

2. <a id="backup"></a>Create a date container. This container contains the state data from your current Rancher Server, and will be used to start the newer version for Rancher Server.

    - Replace `<RANCHER_CONTAINER_ID>` with the same ID from the previous step.
    - Replace `<RANCHER_VERSION>` and `<RANCHER_CONTAINER_TAG>` with the version of Rancher that you are currently running, as mentioned in the  **Prerequisite** above.

    ```bash
docker create --volumes-from <RANCHER_CONTAINER_ID> \
--name rancher-data-<RANCHER_VERSION> rancher/rancher:<RANCHER_CONTAINER_TAG>
    ```

3. Backup state the data from the data container. You will need this for disaster recovery or in case you need to rollback the upgrade.
    ```bash
docker run  --volumes-from rancher-data-<RANCHER_VERSION> -v $PWD:/backup \
alpine tar zcvf /backup/rancher-data-backup-<RANCHER_VERSION>.tar.gz /var/lib/rancher

    ```

3. Restart Rancher Server. Replace `<RANCHER_CONTAINER_ID>` with the ID of your Rancher container.

    ```bash
docker start <RANCHER_CONTAINER_ID>
    ```

**Result:** A backup of your Rancher Server is created. If you ever need to restore your backup, see [Restoring Backups: Single Node Installs]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/restorations/single-node-restoration).
